<p>Many people are scared by the EPUB file structure, because it involves a lot of geek concepts like XML and working on the command line. Why can’t you just use some sort of eBook conversion software like Calibre, InDesign, or Scrivener? These programs are helpful, but they tend to make alterations to metadata, CSS, and your HTML files that you may not want. To do the eBook packaging job with 100% professionalism, it is advised to learn the ins and outs of the EPUB structure. Consult the <a href="http://bbebooksthailand.com/developers.html">BB eBooks Developers page</a> to get into the nitty gritty of this process. We would love to hear from you!</p>
<p>If you are having trouble unzipping this package, try opening the file with a program like 7-Zip. If that doesn’t work, you can change the extension of this file from <span class="tech">.epub</span> to <span class="tech">.zip</span>, then try opening it up. </p>
<p>No matter what eReader you are using, you should be able to see a Table of Contents with this file. There is the NCX Table of Contents (which acts as a “meta” Table of Contents) that gets embedded in the EPUB package. This file is complicated and a little bit ugly, but, thankfully for eBook developers, it is going away with the EPUB 3 standard.</p>
