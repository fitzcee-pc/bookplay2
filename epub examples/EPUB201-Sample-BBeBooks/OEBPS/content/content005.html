<p>By creating an EPUB file, you can also get your books into the MOBI/KF8 format for Amazon using their KindleGen program. This is the best way to create MOBI/KF8 files. However, you have to make a few tweaks to the EPUB data. For some reason, Amazon does not allow you to include a coverpage.html file. They used to, but as of July 2012 the KindleGen program will strip out this file and make a mess of your NCX Table of Contents. Don’t worry, because Kindle Users have access to a button that displays the cover.</p>
<p>An EPUB source file for MOBI/KF8 can be viewed at the <a href="http://bbebooksthailand.com/developers.html">BB eBooks Developers Page</a>. It is very similar to this one.</p>
